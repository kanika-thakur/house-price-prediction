# 🏠 House Price Prediction Web App (Streamlit + SQLite)

## 📌 Project Description
This is a Machine Learning based House Price Prediction Web Application built using **Python, Streamlit, and SQLite database**.  
The app predicts the price of a house based on input features such as area, BHK, bathrooms, and location.  
The model is trained using historical housing data and deployed using Streamlit with secure database support using SQLite.
